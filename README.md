# Multiplayer Clock
Just like a chess clock, but for 1-6 players instead of just 2.

Features:
- Select from 1-5 players
- Individually edit the time for different players
- Count past zero, instead of stopping the timer when a player runs out of time
- Show / hide tenths of a second when players have less than 10 seconds remaining

Want to implement / fix (prioritized):
- automatically lay out rays/times instead of hard coding positions
  - 6 player support
  - better layout on iPad/larger devices
- increments of various flavors, plain, fisher, byo yomi, etc.
- custom colors
- different layouts

Features I don't currently have interest in implementing:
- Edit player's times mid game
- Animation / alert when player's time runs out
- Should pausing when tapping work for the single player timer?
