# Multiplayer Clock
Just like a chess clock, but for 1-6 players instead of just 2.

Features:
- Select from 1-6 players
- Individually edit the time for different players
- Count past zero, instead of stopping the timer when a player runs out of time
- Show / hide tenths of a second when players have less than 10 seconds remaining

Want to implement / fix:
- colon separating minutes/seconds shouldn't move while time counts down (currently the entire label is centered, I think we need to lay out the minute/seconds separately)
- increments of various flavors, plain, fisher, byo yomi, etc.
- custom colors
- different layouts

Features I don't currently have interest in implementing:
- Edit player's times mid game
